              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're

            <p>
              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components:
              <span class="italic"> bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>.
              You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
              let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

              React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source
              library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the
              most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
              section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                <span class="bold">+ components. </span> The rest of this
                introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.

              <li class="item">
                <span class="bold">+ JSX. </span>
                React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <span class="background">
                  &lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;</span
                >.
                <p class="text">
                  The React docs have a
                  <a href="#">comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to
                  learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                  variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                  <span class="background">name</span> for the cat, name, and
                  embedding it with curly braces inside
                  <span class="background">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="item">
                <span class="bold">+ props. </span>Props is short for
                ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
              </li>
              <li class="item">
                <span class="bold">+ state. </span>While you can think of props
                as arguments you use to configure how components render, state
                is handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                interaction. State gives your components memory!

              HANDLING TEXT INPUT <sup class="chapter">Chapter 4</sup>
            </h2>
            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes
              a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
              onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the
              text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
